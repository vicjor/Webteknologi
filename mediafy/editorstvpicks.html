          Finding a good TV show these days is not necessary an easy task. Especially not if you are choosy like me. Most TV shows you find on Netflix, HBO and other streaming services is at best average. Thats why I have written this article to help you find some hidden treasure among all this mediocrity of series. These are my personal favorites, which may have gotten under your radar.

          <img src="images/peakyblinders.jpg" alt="">
          In this British gangster-drama from the 1920's we follow the Shelby family on the rise to the top of the criminal food chain. The main charachter, Thomas Shelby, is a war hero after WWI.

          <h4>Archer</h4>
          <img src="images/archer.jpg" alt="">
          If you consider animations to be childish, think again. Archer is a hilarious adult animation about a secret spy agency, ISIS. Archer is said to be the worlds greatest secret agent, but he is also an obnoxious alcoholic. A great variety of character and high rate of jokes per minute makes this show increadibly funny and easy to watch. The episodes are only 20 minutes long, and you can find most of the seasons available on Netflix.

          <h4>Maniac</h4>
          <img src="images/maniac.jpg" alt="">
          This fall Netflix dropped the American adaption of Espen P.A Lervaags Norwegian show Maniac. Netflix' version is slightly different, and is a dystopian futuristic psychological mindfuck. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone is the lead actors for this 10-episode drama, where both of our main characters is test subjects in an experiment to cure all mental health problems. The show is higly original, and will make you laugh, cry and also confuse you.

          <h4>Black Mirror</h4>
          <img src="images/blackmirror.jpg" alt="">
          First, let me say this is a heavy show. You might find yourself having an existential crisis after watching each episode, and to let the message in each episode really sink in on you, I don't recommend binging this show. An episode or two at the time is more than enough. Each episode has an entirely new plot and story, and there is no connection between the episode. Each episode can be considered as a short movie. What every episode have in common is that they shed light on what challenges humanity might face at technology continues to evolve. The consequences of the technology is put on the tip in each episode to amplify their message, but many of the episodes still experienced as highly realistic. I dont want to spoil to much, but let me say this show draws an dystopian image of the future, and don't always expect a happy ending.
