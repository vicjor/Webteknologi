          This disturbing Netflix original interviews prisoners on death row in USA, and let them tell their stories from their point of view. Each episode focuses on a new prisoner. At times you might even feel empathy for some of the prisoners, even though all of them are sentenced for murder. Other prisoners is just utterly scary, and show little sign of remorse. This is a quality documentary, and you should definitely check it out this fall.

          <img src="images/mayans.jpg" alt="">
          If you've seen Sons of Anarcy, this is a must see. If you haven't, that does not really matter, you should see this anyways. Mayans M.C is a spin-off from Sons of Anarchy, and focuses of the Mayans motorcycle club that as appeared in Sons of Anarchy several times. Following in the footsteps of SOA is no easy task, but Mayans M.C is definitely a worthy spin-off.
