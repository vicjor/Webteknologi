          <h4>1. Pulp Fiction</h4>
          <img src="images/pulpfiction.jpg" alt="">
          Writing a top 5 movie list without one of Quentin Tarantino's movies would be insane. Pulp Fiction is a cult classic, and for a good reason. This movie has the perfect build up, amazing, long dialogues and just the right amount of action. Most of you have probably seen it already, and if you haven't, it should be on the top of your watchlist.

        <div class="text">
          <h4>2. The Dark Knight</h4>
          <img src="images/darkknight.jpg" alt="">
          Superhero movies are usually good action, but rarely Academy Award winning. The second movie in Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy is this good. Heath Ledger delivers maybe the most iconic portayal of a movie villain of all time, and Christian Bale is simply the perfect Batman. Unlike other superhero movies The Dark Knight is rather dark, and not predictable and filled with clichés.

        <div class="text">
          <h4>3. Full Metal Jacket</h4>
          <img src="images/fmj.jpg" alt="">
          Probably the best war movie ever made, and probably will stay the greatest war movie of all time. Stanley Kubricks portayal of the marine force being trained and sent to Vietnam shows just how horrible a war can be, and how the training and battles will change the soldiers for ever. The first half of the movie takes place in a training camp, and the other half in Vietnam.

        <div class="text">
          <h4>4. The Prestige</h4>
          <img src="images/theprestige.jpg" alt="">
          Christopher Nolan's second movie on this top 5 list. That says a lot about the British director. This movie is about two rivalry illusionist played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Even David Bowie have a role in this movie. The result is just absolutely amazing. Through the enitire movie you are the victim of a magic trick without even knowing.

        <div class="text">
          <h4>5. Fight Club</h4>
          <img src="images/fightclub.jpg" alt="">
          An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soapmaker form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more. Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton.
