        This document describes all the changes we have made on the website from what was originally planned in P2. <br>
        It also describes how each of the members of the group has contributed to their tasks to meet the minimum requirements, and who has worked on which files. Finally we will indicate how we achieved modularity for the webpage.

      <h3>Changes</h3>

      <div class="text">
        <strong>Background color: </strong> We decided to change the background color of our page from blue to a yellow/brown-ish color.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Footer: </strong> We also made some changes to the footer. We changed the design a bit, and chose to remove all pseudo links/info, and just keep the subscribe button there along with the name of the service.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Articles: </strong> We made some change to the articles on the page. We decided on having three articles each for music, movie and series. <br>
        Series:
        <ul>
          <li>New releases (newseries.html)</li>
          <li>This years Halloween show (thisweeksshow.html)</li>
          <li>Editor's picks (editorstvpicks.html)</li>
        </ul>
        Movies:
        <ul>
          <li>All time top 5 movies (top5movies.html)</li>
          <li>This week's movie (citizienkane.html)</li>
          <li>Coming soon: Once upon a time in Hollywood (comingsoon.html)</li>
        </ul>
        Music:
        <ul>
          <li>Editor's picks (editorspicksmusic.html)</li>
          <li>Jacob Banks Release (jacobbanksrelease.html)</li>
          <li>This week's artist (thisweeksartist.html)</li>
          <li>Jorja Smith Covers Kendrick x SZA (jorja.html)</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>
        <strong>Changes to frontpage: </strong> We made some changes to our frontpage. We decided not to use a slider, and replaced it with a simple JavaScript flashing in different colors, and changing text between keywords for Mediafy. We also decided to remove the subscribe div, and decided to just keep the subscribe function in the footer. Instead we added a div with top stories within all the topics.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Navbar: </strong> The navbar is pretty much the same, but we made a few changes. When the window get smaller, a menu bar will pop up istead of all categories, and clicking this menu bar will open a dropdown menu with the remaing categories. The styling of the fonts is also slight different from our mockup. We also added an effect with a line sliding under the link when hovering over.
        <br><br>
        <strong>JavaScript: </strong> We decided to remove the "randompicks.js" and "coverAnimation.js" files, as we had to focus on completed the page rather than extra functions. However as described above we added an effect(middleimageslider.js) with images and text changing describing some keywords for Mediafy.

      <h3>Contribution by team members</h3>
      <div class="text">
        Originally we started out with 5 members of the group. In the beginning of the semester, Erling W. and Hedda decided to withdraw from the course, leaving Victor, William and Erling O. up for the task. Continuing through the semester, Erling did not fulfill his duties, leaving it to Victor and William to complete the project. So William and Victor are the only ones that have been contributing to this project, making it a lot of work.
        <br><br>
        Victor have worked on the following files:
        <ul>
          <li>mainstyle.css</li>
          <li>about.html</li>
          <li>movies.html</li>
          <li>series.html</li>
          <li>citizienkane.html</li>
          <li>newseries.html</li>
          <li>thisweeksshow.html</li>
          <li>top5movies.html</li>
          <li>editorstvpicks.html</li>
          <li>comingsoon.html</li>
          <li>footer.js</li>
          <li>subscribe.js</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        William have worked on these files:
        <ul>
          <li>mainstyle.css (having done more work than Victor on the CSS)</li>
          <li>index.html</li>
          <li>music.html</li>
          <li>movies.html</li>
          <li>series.html</li>
          <li>eidtorspicksmusic.html</li>
          <li>thisweeksartist.html</li>
          <li>jacobsbanksrelease.html</li>
          <li>jorja.html</li>
          <li>middleimageslider.js</li>
          <li>navbar.js</li>

        </ul>
