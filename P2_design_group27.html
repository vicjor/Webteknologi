      <h2>Our service</h2>
      <p>Mediafy is a service created by co-founders William Østensen, Victor Jørgensen and Erling Olweus. All three authors are students at NTNU in the course IT2805 Webteknologi.
  	     The idea behind Mediafy is to let the user explore new music, movies and TV shows.</p>

      <div class="purpose">
      <h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
      <p>Mediafy's purpose is to deliver top recommendations of the best music, movies and TV-shows
      to media enthusiats. The goal of Mediafy is to recommend trending music, media and TV, editors picks and IMDB
      recommendations while giving people a easy-to-use and clean site to learn about the newest within music, movies and series. </p>

      <div class="structure">
      <h2>Navigation structure</h2>
      <p>
        The navigation structure of Mediafy's website is overall hierarchial; The mainpage is at the top and have access to all the subpages and some of the articles featured on the frontpage(top stories).
        Next we have the subpages(music, film, series and about). These can reach eachother and the mainpage in a linear fashion through the navigation bar/meny. In addition the subpages will have different articles concerning each of these topics(exception in the about page which will only have information about the company).
        These different articles about distinct topics within music, film and series can only be reached from the respective subpage. That means that you can not click directly into an article about music from the film subpage, you'll have to go through the music subpage.
        From these articles you will be able to click directly into the different subpages and mainpage via the navbar, but you cannot however go directly from one article to another one in a linear fashion regardless of what subpage the article belongs to. This is to clearly separate which topic the different articles belongs to and give the site and easy to use and understand structure.

        PAGE LAYOUT AND APPEARANCE

      <div class="layout">
      <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
      <p>In making the decision about our page layout and design we wanted to focus on our goal to make the website have a clean and dark look with a sort of "vintage"-vibe. Therefore we chose to use a dark blue background (#28546C) with a very dark blue/light black article background and black, white and light gray  for nabber, footer and texts complementing these colors. We also wanted to focus on cool imagery and titles that helps the design of the page reach these goals. With this use of colors and images and trendy look we appeal to the target audience(younger users). This is also the reason for the modern and easy-look on the navbar. For fonts we will use Garamond for titles and Helvetica(Neue) for article texts.

      <h3>1. The front page - index.html</h3>
      <p>The front page, index.html, will be the first page to appear when visiting the website.
      The front page will link to several subpages, but not all of them. On the top of the page there will be clickable images to editors pick, this weeks artist, series to watch this fall
      and this week in musiv. A javascript application will make sure that different articles will be shown.

      In the center we will have a slider through all three categories of the page; music, film and series. We are planning on using a javascript application
      for this slider.

      At the bottom of the front page, and also at the bottom of every subpage, we will have a footer with a subscription button to our newsletter, and generel information a pseudo links to
      forum, jobs, help, etc. To avoid repetition will will not type this in in all of the following page descriptions.
